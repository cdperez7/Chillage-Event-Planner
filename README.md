### Project Description
For our First Project, we've created an application that will allow users to see local events they might be interested in. Users will input an event keyword and their zip code. The app will then generate a list of events depending on user input and also display the exact locations on the Google Map. 

### Front End Design
The front end contains a video of a concert in the background and is pushed to the back using the Z-index. The playback rate is slowed 50% for a better viewing experience. The natural lighting of the concert illuminates the results (which have an opaque background) as an intentional stylistic idea. We wanted a clean, simple website where everything was dynamically updated on one home page to simplify everything for the user.
